This is the R-pentomino Methuselahs per chatGPT4.

"It's also worth noting that some specific patterns, called "Methuselahs," have a small initial configuration but take a very long time to stabilize. The most famous of these is the R-pentomino, which takes 1,103 generations to stabilize. You can explore the vast world of Game of Life patterns to find configurations that lead to interesting and long-lasting evolutions."
